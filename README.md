# Cowrie Tracker
A Minimialistic Cowrie Honeypot Visualization tool

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Cowrie is nowhere near to be done, and I am pretty new to web development so.. yea :).

### Prerequisites
Ubuntu Machine. So far Cowrie Tracker has been Tested in Ubuntu 14.04 x64 LTS but it would possibly work on other Ubuntu versions.

### Installing

Just clone the repository and execute
```
sudo ./cowrie_setup.sh
