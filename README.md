# DionTrack
A simple Dionaea Honeypot Tracker and Malware Collector

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
DionTrack is nowhere near to be done, and I am pretty new to web development so.. yea :).

### Prerequisites
Ubuntu Machine. So far DionTrack has been Tested in Ubuntu 14.04 x64 LTS but it would possibly work on other Ubuntu version, but it has not been tested.

### Installing

Just clone the repository and execute
```
sudo ./setup.sh
```
This script will download the latest release of Dionaea from DinoTools [repo](https://github.com/DinoTools/dionaea) who is actively administrating the Dionaea project.
